## ABOUT ME

My coding journey first began during lockdown as a way to pass the time, initially I had very little expectation but soon fell in love with the process of writing and debugging my own code.  My introduction to coding was though independent learning completing various online Udemy courses which I used to learn Python and associated libraries.  This allowed me to build my first web application a stock trading strategy app using Python, Django and HTML.  Keen to further develop my skills and connect with like minded individuals I joined the Makers Academy Bootcamp. This highly valuable experience not only provided me with a structured approach to my learning but also exposed me to industry best practices. As a result, I not only refined my technical skills but also began to cultivate a valuable network within the tech community.

I've always considered myself to have an engineering mindset, and discovering software engineering only intensified that belief.  I have taken great satisfaction conceptualising ideas, planning out projects and building applications.  My fascination with technology, coupled with the belief that software has the power to positively impact the world, motivates me to contribute meaningfully to the field.  I believe that my drive and eagerness to continually learn will make me a valuable addition to any software engineering team, and I look forward to contributing to projects that have the potential to shape the future positively.
